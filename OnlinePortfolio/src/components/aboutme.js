        <h1>A Little About Me </h1>

        <p>I am currently a senior pursuing my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with a minor 
          in mathematics at University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I am looking for an internship
           where I can grow my knowledge and expand my skills in software development. Recently, due to 
           the Covid-19 virus, my software engineering internship got canceled and I have lost the opportunity 
           to gain real-world experience. I believe this type of on-site work is extremely valuable, which is
            why I am pursuing this opportunity.</p>

      <p>Throughout my college experience so far, I have had a multitude of various opportunities to gain skills
       which include but are not limited to extensive knowledge of programming, math algorithms and coding languages.
        I have proficient knowledge on Python, C, C++, Unix, SQL, AWS, HTML and basic skills with Java and Racket. 
        Regarding side projects and some school projects, I have had various experiences using git and GitHub. 
        I am also pursuing my certification in AWS alongside my college education to learn about the future of cloud computing. Lastly, I have a fundamental understanding of MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node), where I developed a simple website that was linked to a database which contained users’ permissions that dictated their access to certain data.
      My positive attitude, authenticity and excellent communication skills allow me to stand out from other applicants.</p>
      
      <p>I have a wide range of experiences with past working opportunities from selling ice cream to interning as an 
       IT intern in an office. I believe in the importance of being a team player, having the ability to follow directions, 
       and ensuring that projects are handled professionally. I possess excellent research, analytical and critical thinking 
       skills along with excellent writing and presentational skills.</p></div>
